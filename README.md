# GITHUB ACTIONS FILES

This is a place to find .YML files for your github action 42 testers.

## Why should I use?

If your tester is not working in the linux/windows or if you wish to test every time you do a git push in github. This is a free solution for you.

## How can I help?

If you wish to help just make a pull request with your .YML file and a README.md

## Can't find a file for my tester

If you didn't find the github action file that you need here, go to this site and make yours:

````

Don't forget to send a pull request here  after you finish your file. ;)
