# GITHUB ACTION FILES

This is a place to find .YML files for your github action 42 testers.

## Why should I use this?

You should use this if your tester isn't working on Linux/Windows,
or if you wish to automatically run all tests every time
you push to your github repo.
Github actions are completely free and extremely convenient.

## How can I help?

If you wanna help just open a pull request with your .YML file,
and add it to the table in this `README`.

## Can't find a file for my tester

If you didn't find the github action file you were looking for, go to this site
and make it yourself:

```
https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
```

Don't forget to open a pull request here after you create your file. ;)
